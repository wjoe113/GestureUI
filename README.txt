Assignment1 CAP6105:Pen-Based User Interfaces

In this assignemnt I created my very own recognizer using ShortStraw. Short story: Everything works!

The application is pretty straight-forward. Once you open the application you can start drawing shapes. If the
recognizer likes the shape it will tell you what it is and how many corners it found. Press the clear button
to clear the ink canvas and the exit button to exit. Have fun!
